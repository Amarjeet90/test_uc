Hey [~nherman], 

I did some analysis on the issue and did try to reproduce but was not able to reproduce this. The issue is around the incorrect credentials entered by the user. 

I have attached a video which shows the errors on Vantage for 3.4.4.72 build which shows that Vantage on getting invalid credentials is displaying the errors correctly. 

00:44 Error shown when Equinox on Vantage is opened. 
01:11 Error shown when Equinox on Vantage on TOM.
01:25 Android Notification centre shows the incorrect credentials for Unified Login
01:30 I enter credentials with a wrong password.
01:55 Vantage displays invalid credentials as a Toast on TOM
02:03  Android Notification centre shows the incorrect credentials for Unified Login
02:08 I enter the correct credentials and the Vantage gets logged in with all the services configured properly. 

Can you please check with impacted users if they saw the same things on their devices?

Thanks
Shiv
